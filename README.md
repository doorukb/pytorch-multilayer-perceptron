A PyTorch reimplementation of the same multilayer perceptron family as the [NumPy Gradient Descent MLP](https://github.com/doorukb/gradient-descent-mlp). The project uses autograd for training, logs experiments to MLflow, runs a fixed hyperparameter grid with strict train/validation/test discipline, registers the sweep winner in the Model Registry, and loads that model by registry URI for inference-only promotion. Analytical gradients are checked against the NumPy reference in `experiments/01_parity_check.py`.

## What it does

The network learns from the same synthetic surface as the NumPy project: Z = X^2 - Y^2 + 1.2 + noise, where X and Y are drawn uniformly from [-1, 1] and noise is Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5. Inputs are 2D (X, Y).

For the hyperparameter sweep, the continuous target Z is binarized into class labels: label = 1 when Z > 1.2, else 0. Selection uses validation AUC; F1 is reported alongside. The baseline run (`experiments/02_baseline_run.py`) keeps the original regression formulation (MSE on Z) as a sanity check on the shared surface.

Gradient parity (`experiments/01_parity_check.py`) compares PyTorch autograd to the NumPy backprop implementation on architecture [2, 4, 1] for sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU. Clone the NumPy repo as a sibling `Multilayer-Perceptron` directory or set `NUMPY_MLP_SRC` to its `src/` path.

## Relationship to the NumPy MLP

[Multilayer-perceptron](https://github.com/doorukb/gradient-descent-mlp) implements forward pass, backpropagation, MSE loss, and gradient descent entirely in NumPy. This repo reuses the same surface generator and split logic, validates that PyTorch gradients match the hand-derived NumPy gradients, then extends the workflow with MLflow tracking, artifact logging, a hyperparameter sweep, and model registry promotion. The NumPy README links here under Roadmap.

Selected configuration (highest validation AUC):

    architecture:  [2, 5, 5, 2]
    learning rate: 0.01
    dropout:       0.0
    best val AUC:  0.5500
    test AUC:      0.5147
    test F1:       0.6560

The near-random AUC is expected given the classification setup: the decision boundary for Z > 1.2 on this surface is |X| ≈ |Y|, a nonlinear curve that a small network with 20 SGD epochs cannot reliably fit through high-variance noise. The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate MLflow's tracking infrastructure — systematic logging, run comparison, registry, and promotion — on a reproducible grid. The Adam vs SGD comparison in experiment 05 shows meaningful regression results on the same surface.

Model promotion (experiment 04):

Loads the sweep winner from the MLflow Model Registry at `models:/torchmlp-mlp/{version}` (not a local path or `runs:/` URI), prints the source run ID for lineage, and evaluates on the held-out test split without retraining.

    registry URI:  models:/torchmlp-mlp/latest
    test AUC:      0.5147
    test F1:       0.6560

## Comparison Conclusions

Same synthetic surface, same seed, same architecture [2, 10, 1].

    method           framework    optimizer       epochs    test_mse
    NumPy MLP        NumPy        full-batch SGD  2000      0.2536
    PyTorch MLP      PyTorch      SGD             200       0.210453
    PyTorch MLP      PyTorch      Adam            200       0.251560

Both PyTorch variants match or beat the NumPy result in 200 mini-batch epochs, which is a fraction of the 2000 full-batch iterations NumPy required. PyTorch SGD leads here because lr=0.05 is well-suited to this surface; Adam's advantage is reduced learning rate sensitivity, which shows more clearly on complex tasks where tuning is expensive. The implementation point stands: Adam in NumPy requires tracking first and second moment estimates from scratch; here it is torch.optim.Adam, one line.

NumPy full-batch SGD requires 2000 gradient steps across the full dataset to approach the noise floor. PyTorch with Adam reaches comparable quality in 200 mini-batch epochs.

The implementation difference: Adam required tracking first and second gradient moments from scratch in the NumPy project, here it is torch.optim.Adam, one line, no derivation.

The framework gives you the optimizer family for free; the from-scratch project proves you know what it is computing.

Experiments:

    torchmlp-surface           baseline regression run (experiment 02)
    torchmlp-hyperparam-sweep  18 grid trials plus sweep-winner run (experiment 03)
    torchmlp-sgd-vs-adam       SGD vs Adam comparison (experiment 05)

Model Registry tab: registered model name `torchmlp-mlp`. Each sweep-winner retrain creates a new version.

Optional: pin a specific registry version before promotion:

    Windows PowerShell:  $env:MLFLOW_MODEL_VERSION = "2"
    Linux / macOS:       export MLFLOW_MODEL_VERSION=2
    python experiments/04_model_promotion.py

MLflow 3+ blocks the default file store unless you set `MLFLOW_ALLOW_FILE_STORE=true` or point tracking at SQLite, for example `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=sqlite:///mlflow.db`.

Per-run artifacts include hyperparameters, per-epoch train/val metrics, a learning-curve PNG, and the serialized PyTorch model.

## Testing

To run all tests from the project root:

    pytest tests/ -v

- `tests/test_config.py` — `TrainConfig` layer sizes, validation rules, and MLflow param serialization
- `tests/test_data.py` — surface sampling, dataset sizes, binary classification labels, reproducible splits
- `tests/test_metrics.py` — accuracy, F1, and AUC helpers for classification evaluation
- `tests/test_model.py` — MLP layer shapes, Xavier initialization, activations, output-layer linearity
- `tests/test_preprocessing.py` — train/test split ratios and feature scaler fit without data leakage
- `tests/test_parity.py` — gradient parity against the NumPy reference; skips gracefully if the `Multilayer-Perceptron` sibling repo is not cloned and `NUMPY_MLP_SRC` is unset
- `tests/test_trainer.py` — `fit`/`train` loss reduction, eval/train modes, classification training path; `test_zero_grad_prevents_accumulation` demonstrates that gradients double without `zero_grad()` and reset correctly when it is called
- `tests/test_tracking.py` — MLflow logging helpers and `fit` integration; uses SQLite per-test via `tmp_path` so runs never pollute the repo `mlruns/` directory
- `tests/test_hyperparam_sweep.py` — grid size (18 configs), classification task settings, winner selection by validation AUC
- `tests/test_model_promotion.py` — registry URI scheme, version resolution, and registered-model load round-trip
